Nmap/Parser version 0.79
============================

nmap output parser in perl

This perl module is here to ease the pain of developing scripts or collecting
network information from nmap scans. Nmap::Parser does its task by parsing the
information in the output of an nmap scan by using the xml-formatted output.
An nmap parser for xml scan data using perl. Nmap Parser is a PERL module that
makes developing security and audit tools using nmap and perl easier. 

I am trying to balance efficiency with ease of use. If you think something
can be done differently send your feedback.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.16+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.

CHANGES

Changes from 0.78 to 0.79
	- fixed ports that were declared as 'open|filtered'
	    these now are counted as both 'open' and 'filtered'
	    when using tcp_ports() and udp_ports().
	- sent a patch for XML::Twig in order to fix. It is now released in
	    XML:Twig 3.16
	- added start_str() and time_str() : they return the human readable format
	of the scan start time and scan finish time (respectively).
	- updated for Nmap 3.81
	- documentation changes
