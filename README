Nmap/Parser version 0.78
============================

nmap output parser in perl

This perl module is here to ease the pain of developing scripts or collecting
network information from nmap scans. Nmap::Parser does its task by parsing the
information in the output of an nmap scan by using the xml-formatted output.

I am trying to balance efficiency with ease of use. If you think something
can be done differently send your feedback.

INSTALLATION

Latest version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/npx
		http://search.cpan.org/~apersaud/Nmap-Parser/
Website:        http://npx.sourceforge.net/

Download the file and unpack. This is usually done by:

   tar xvf Nmap-Parser-x.xx.tar.gz

Where x.xx is the version number. Next change into the newly created directory.
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.09+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.
