Nmap/Parser version 1.01
============================

parse nmap scan data with perl

This module implements a interface to the information contained in an nmap scan.
It is implemented by parsing the xml scan data that is generated by nmap. This
will enable anyone who utilizes nmap to quickly create fast and robust security scripts
that utilize the powerful port scanning abilities of nmap.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.16+
	Storable

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.
