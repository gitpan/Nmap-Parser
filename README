Nmap/Parser version 0.76
============================

nmap output parser in perl

This module is intended to sift through the nmap scan outputs in xml form,
either by passing a filehandle that is being piped from a current nmap scan
or using an xml filename that is formatted as the output of nmap when using
the '-oX file.xml' command line option. It uses the XML::Twig library, which is
memory efficient and fast. In the authors opinion, this module is very easy to
use to extract information from an nmap xml scan output about the scan itself
and the hosts that were scanned.

I am trying to balance efficiency with ease of use. If you think something
can be done differently send your feedback.

INSTALLATION

Latest version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/npx
		http://search.cpan.org/~apersaud/Nmap-Parser/
Website:        http://npx.sourceforge.net/

Download the file and unpack. This is usually done by:

   tar xvf Nmap-Parser-x.xx.tar.gz

Where x.xx is the version number. Next change into the newly created directory.
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.09+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.
