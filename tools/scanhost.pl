=head1 NAME

scanhost - a scanning script to gather port and OS information from hosts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 scanhost.pl [OPTS] <IP_ADDR> [<IP.ADDR> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script uses the nmap security scanner with the Nmap::Parser module
in order to run quick scans against specific hosts, and gather all the
information that is required to know about that specific host which nmap can
figure out. This script can be used for quick audits against machines on the
network and an educational use for learning how to write scripts using the
Nmap::Parser module. B<This script uses the -sV output to get version
information of the services running on a machine. This requires nmap version
3.49+>

=head1 OPTIONS

These options are passed as command line parameters.

=over 4

=item B<-a>

This tells the script only to output the information for the hosts that found
in state active or status is 'up'.

=item B<-i nmapscan.xml>

Runs the script using the given xml file (which is nmap xml scan data) instead
of actually running a scan against the given set of hosts. This is useful if
you only have the xml data on a given machine, and not nmap.

=item B<--fast>

Runs a fast (-F) nmap scan against the host.

=item B<-h,--help,-?>

Shows this help information.

=item B<-L ips.txt>

Reads IP addresses from filename.txt to run a scan against. The IP addresses
should be in the target specification format explained below.

=item B<-U>

When running scans, (not using input xml files with -i), this includes scanning
for UDP ports. Note that enabling UDP ports scans increases the time required
for the scanning to finish.

=item B<-v>

This runs the script in verbose mode. The more times used, the more verbose
the script will be.

=back 4

=head1 TARGET SPECIFICATION

This documentation was taken from the nmap man page. The IP address inputs
to this scripts should be in the nmap target specification format.

The  simplest  case is listing single hostnames or IP addresses onthe command
line. If you want to scan a subnet of  IP addresses, you can append '/mask' to
the hostname or IP address. mask must be between 0 (scan the whole internet) and
 32 (scan the single host specified). Use /24 to scan a class 'C' address and
 /16 for a class 'B'.

You can use a more powerful notation which lets you specify an IP address
using lists/ranges for each element. Thus you can scan the whole class 'B'
network 128.210.*.* by specifying '128.210.*.*' or '128.210.0-255.0-255' or
even use the mask notation: '128.210.0.0/16'. These are all equivalent.
If you use asterisks ('*'), remember that most shells require you to escape
them with  back  slashes or protect them with quotes.

Another interesting thing to do is slice the Internet the other way.

Examples:

 scanhost.pl 127.0.0.1
 scanhost.pl target.example.com
 scanhost.pl target.example.com/24
 scanhost.pl 10.210.*.1-127
 scanhost.pl *.*.2.3-5
 scanhost.pl 10.[10-15].10.[2-254]


=head1 OUTPUT EXAMPLE

These are ONLY examples of how the output would look like.
